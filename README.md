# Notes:
 - Any unity projects are built versions because it's more lightweight.
 - The unity projects caused ASP.NET to be blown out of proportion in the languages display.
 - Things with **Tutorial** mostly based off a tutorial, usually to learn a new system.
 - Things with **Coursework** were projects I was told to do. Anything without it was just because I felt like doing it.
